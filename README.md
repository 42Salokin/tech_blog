  This application is a CMS-style blog site where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts. It uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication. 

  Users can sign up, login, and logout. All current posts are displayed on homepage. Clicking on any post displays just that post with any comments that have been left, and allows user to leave a comment. After logging in, user can go to dashboard to view their posts, create a new post, or edit/delete an existing post.

  Live site deployed to Render at:  https://tech-blog-p0i5.onrender.com
